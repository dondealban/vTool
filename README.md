## vTool - Validation Plugin for Quantum GIS

Note: This plugin was development in Python with PyQT 4. To use this plugin you need Quantum GIS Version > 2.0. If you want to install it directly via QGIS Plugins, find it [here](http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/vTool/).

Description: Validation algorithm is based on the scientific work of P.Olofsson named 'Making better use of accuracy data in land change studies: Estimating accuracy and area quantifying uncertainty using stratified estimation'. 
The algorithm considers reference data to estimate the area per class. In this new version there is also example data included in order to show how the input data has to be represented. 

This tool was developed by Ren√© Kopeinig MSc. (UNDP) with support of Julian Equihua and Dr. Steffen Gebhardt (Conabio). This plugin was developed in order to have the possibility to validate the in Conabio derived MAD-Mex landcover classification and change products with the algorithm of P.Olofsson.
