Note: This plugin was development in Python with PyQT 4. To use this plugin you need Quantum GIS Version > 2.0

Description: Validation algorithm is based on the scientific work of P.Olofsson named 'Making better use of accuracy data in land change studies: Estimating accuracy and area quantifying uncertainty using stratified estimation'. 
The algorithm considers reference data to estimate the area per class. In this new version there is also example data included in order to show how the input data has to be represented.
